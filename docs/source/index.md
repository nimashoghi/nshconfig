## About nshconfig

As a machine learning researcher, I often found myself running numerous training jobs with various hyperparameters for the models I was working on. Keeping track of these parameters in a fully typed manner became increasingly important. While the excellent `pydantic` library provided most of the functionality I needed, I wanted to add a few extra features to streamline my workflow. This led to the creation of `nshconfig`.

## Credit

`nshconfig` is built on top of the incredible [pydantic](https://github.com/pydantic/pydantic/) library. Massive credit goes to the `pydantic` team for creating such a powerful and flexible tool for data validation and settings management.
