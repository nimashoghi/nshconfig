## Motivation

`nshconfig` extends Pydantic to provide enhanced configuration management features, particularly focused on:

- Maintaining strongly typed configuration hierarchies
- Supporting dynamic configuration systems and plugins
- Streamlining parameter management for complex experiments
- Providing better IDE support and type checking
- Enabling clean integration with ML frameworks

While Pydantic provides excellent core functionality for data validation, `nshconfig` adds specialized features for handling complex configuration scenarios and experimental workflows.

## Credit

`nshconfig` is built on top of the incredible [pydantic](https://github.com/pydantic/pydantic/) library. Massive credit goes to the `pydantic` team for creating such a powerful and flexible tool for data validation and settings management.
