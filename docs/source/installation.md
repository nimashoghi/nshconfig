# Installation

You can install `nshconfig` via pip:

```bash
pip install nshconfig
```

For YAML support, you'll need to install additional dependencies:

```bash
pip install "nshconfig[yaml]"   # Installs only the YAML extra
```

For TOML support, install:

```bash
pip install "nshconfig[toml]"
```

You may also install all extras at once:

```bash
pip install "nshconfig[extra]"
```
