# Installation

You can install `nshconfig` via pip:

```bash
pip install nshconfig
```

For YAML support, you'll need to install additional dependencies:

```bash
pip install "nshconfig[extra]"  # Installs all extras
pip install "nshconfig[yaml]"   # Installs only the YAML extra
```

Alternatively, you can install the YAML dependency directly:

```bash
pip install pydantic-yaml
```
